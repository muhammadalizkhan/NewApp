# NewApp
I will build a hybrid news app using Ionic 6 & Angular 15+ which will be able to run on Web, Android, & iOS devices using a single codebase. The app is built using NewsAPI for fetching the news details, and we have a sidebar navigation view and 8 news categories. I will implement News API in our application & complete working application.
